{  HOW TO USE THE NET TO HIT HOMES AND WEBSITES  }

# The modules with a checkmark next to them, are the ones you will be using. To choose which module to use. type it in the command line at the bottom. Example : I want to hit home connections.  l4    then press enter. l = lowercase L. 
# Example: I want to hit website connections.  l7    then press enter. 
1. This is what your going to see at the bottom, when you first enter the net: 

Modules:
|-- l4                         :: Load the layer4 module. (UDP/TCP)
|-- l3                         :: Load the layer3 module. (ICMP)
|-- l7                         :: Load the layer7 module. (HTTP)
|-- bl                         :: Load the bluetooth module. (L2CAP)
|-- arp                        :: Load the arp spoofing module. (ARP)
|-- wifi                       :: Load the wifi module. (IEEE)
|-- server                     :: Load the server module for DDos atacks.

# If you typed l4 this is what you should see at the top. 

|-- Main commands:
|   |-- port             :: Set the target's port.
|   |-- threads          :: Set the number of threads.
|   |-- ip               :: Set the target's IP.
|   |-- web              :: Target the ip of a domain.
|   |-- method           :: Change attack method between UPD, TCP.
|   |-- sleep            :: Set the time delay between each packet send.
|   |-- outtxt           :: Output each packets send status: enable/disable.
|   |-- mute             :: Do not output the connection reply.
|   |-- values or ls     :: Show all selected options.
|   |-- run              :: Start the attack.

# Type ip   in the command line, and press enter, then enter the targets ip address.
# Type port   in the command line and press enter, then enter targets home connection port (80) 
# Type method   in the command line and press enter to switch to UDP (for home connections)
# Type threads    in the command line and press enter, then enter the amount of threads [2-5]
# Type sleep    in the command line and press enter, then enter the time delayy for each packet sent [5-10]
# Type run     in the command line and press enter, to startup the attack.
# Enter Y     in the command line and press enter, to begin the attack (BE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE TOS BEFORE HITTING) 

# To stop the attack, press enter on your keyboard, CTR + C or exit out of the terminal. 

# If you have not read the TOS, it is below: 

# [+] BEFORE USING THIS NET, READ TOS [+]

# THIS IS INTENDED FOR PROPER USAGE, IF YOU DECIDE TO HIT SOMEONES HOME WIFI
# I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS! GOBLINCRACK IS ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE
# DO AS YOU PLEASE WITH SOFTWARE BUT DO NOT HIT ANY .GOV WEBSITES!
# THAT WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THIS TOOL. MEANING THIS NET 
# WILL LOCK YOU OUT OF THE NET AND LOOSE CONNECTION TO OUR SERVER!

If you chose l7 to hit websites, here is how to use it. 

# Type target   in the command line and press enter, (to set the targeted website) (the complete url of the website)
# Type threads   in the command line and press enter, (to set the amount of threads for the attack) [2-5]
# Type sleep      in the command line and press enter, (to set the delay between each thread) [2-5]
# Type interval    in the command line and press enter, (to set a delay between each packet sent) [5-10]
# Type run       in the command line and press enter, to start up the attack.
# Enter Y      in the command line and press enter, to begin the attack (BE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE TOS BEFORE HITTING)

# To stop the attack, press enter on your keyboard, CTR + C or exit the terminal 

Those are really the only methods you need to know on how to use, the rest is it your hitting another high end net which is unethical completely.
